# Affirm Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* The company I am reseraching is Affirm. Affirm was founded in 2012 by a group of founders, the most notable being Max Levchin, who was also a co-founder of Pay-Pal. Affirm came about because him and his co-founders saw an opportunity to make retail sales more accessible, and so they sought out a method to bring the power of financing to purchases of all size. They are still a private company but are in very late roudns of funding. Teh last funding round they raised $500 million through series G funding. Up to date they have rasied about $1.5 billion in venture capital and private funding, which has allowed them to jumpstart to where they are today. In November 2020 they did file for an IPO, but since then they have decided to delay their IPO and remain private. Affirm has also previoulsy raised a few million in debt financing as well, although a majority of its capital comes from the equity I previousy mentioned. 


## Business Activities:

* In todays world, it is not easy to balance long term financial goals and saving with todays needs and wants. Affirm hopes to make that easier by providing instant low-rate financing for retail purchases, ranging from a few dollars to a few thousand dollars. This can help ease the burden of making large purchases today with cash, as they provide 3, 6, and 12 month financing options for most products. Most of the time they also offer a 0% interest option as well. 

* The way this works is very similar to Paypal or ApplePay, when you are checking out your merchandise on adidas.com for example, you will get an option to "pay with Affirm". Then you will get prompted an option to pay in 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, with Interest Rates, monthly payments, and total payments clearly listed for each option. This 3rd party payment option technology is nothing new or groundbreaking, but where Affirm has an edge is the fact that they can instantly grant personal loans of any size without any red tape or hidden fees. I think the ease of access and the transparency that Affirm offers is where it gets its advantage. No other company today can issue loans so clearly and so quickly, and that makes Affirm very appealing for customers and businesses. 

* Affirm has partnered with many large ecommerce and retail companies such as Shopify, Adidas, Dicks, BigCommerce, and more. Their ability to make a consumers purchasing decisions easier and more hassel-free has proven effective in growing retail sales. Some of Affirms retail partners have reported as much as an 85% increase in average order value. From a businesses perspective, this technology has the power to not only improve sales, but also improve customer experience and satisfaction, which is something that businesses are constantly seeking. This is why Affirm has the ability to venture out and partner with hundreds of retailers, and continue growing. 

* The primary competitor to Affirm is essentially the entire Credit Card industry. Many years ago, Credit Cards were invented with a very similar purpose as Affirm, to give consumers the ability to finance day-to-day purchases. Were credit cards today lack is the insanely large interest rates they charge and also the many hidden and late fees they charge. You can see how large of a market Credit Cards have been able to create/capture, and that gives us some insight into Affirms potential market size. According to the Central Reserve Bank of Atlanta, about 75% of americans have at least 1 credit card. Obviously it is hard to say whther or not Affirm can capture the entire Credit Card market, but they are positioned to make quite a large splash in that industry. 

* After doing a deep dive into how Affirm works, I learned that Affirm uses much more than just a FICO credit score to assess a customers credit worthiness. I think that this is becoming a trend in the lending industry with the availability of many new technologies such as *Machine Learning*, and many new customer datapoints such as online bank statements and social media. Affirm can use **AI** technology, and scrape through many customer data points and give out an accurate interest rate within seconds instead of weeks. As you can see, this powerful technology powering teh backend of Affirm, paired with the transparency and ease of access offered on the front-end, Affirm is positioning itself to make a big splash in the Point of Sale lending and retail industry.
